Chapter 1: The Boy Who Lived
Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.
None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. "Little tyke," chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive.
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.
He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the bakery. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.
"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard--"
"--yes, their son, Harry--"
Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in cloaks...
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.
"Sorry," he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, "Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!"
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination.
As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.
"Shoo!" said Mr. Dursley loudly.
The cat didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.
Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word ("Won't!"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:
"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern." The newscaster allowed himself a grin. "Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?"
"Well, Ted," said the weatherman, "I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight."
Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...
Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. "Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?"
As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.
"No," she said sharply. "Why?"
"Oh, no reason," said Mr. Dursley quickly. "Funny stuff on the news," he mumbled. "Owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today..."
"So?" snapped Mrs. Dursley.
"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd."
Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name "Potter." He decided he didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, "Their son -- he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?"
"I suppose so," said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.
"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?"
"Harry. Nasty little thing. He was at our wedding."
"Was he?" said Mr. Dursley, who genuinely didn't remember. "What did he look like?"
"Scrawny little thing, not nearly as cute as Dudley, and he had glasses."
Mr. Dursley didn't say anything more. He didn't want to worry his wife. He didn't even want to worry himself, because he knew there couldn't be anything in it. Potter wasn't an uncommon name, and he was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. Anyway, he thought, as he got into bed beside Mrs. Dursley, who was already snoring gently, people who wore cloaks didn't set much store by things like cars and telephones. He'd never heard of a car breaking down in the middle of the night and the driver saying, "No problem, I'll get my cloak out and fly home." And when he'd heard the old man talking about You-Know-Who, well, it was easy to dismiss that, too. People who dressed like that were obviously unhinged.
Mr. Dursley fell asleep quickly and didn't wake until his alarm rang at seven o'clock the next morning. He lay there for a moment, blinking in the dawn light, then remembered what had been worrying him. He got up quickly, hurried to the window, and peered out at the garden wall. The cat was gone. He breathed a sigh of relief and went to wake Dudley.
The Dursleys had a very ordinary sort of breakfast, which was just what Mr. Dursley liked. They had bacon and eggs and toast and tea and Dudley had a large glass of orange juice. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked up his briefcase. He was halfway to the door when the telephone rang. Mrs. Dursley looked at it.
"Aren't you going to answer it?" she asked.
"I'll let it ring," said Mr. Dursley. "It'll be for you. I expect it's that Mrs. Figg; she's always ringing up at this time of day."
Mrs. Dursley looked startled.
"Mrs. Figg? Why would she be ringing me?"
"Oh, I don't know," said Mr. Dursley, who was halfway out the door. "To borrow some sugar, or something. Bye, dear."
But Mrs. Dursley didn't go to answer the phone. She stood rooted to the spot, staring at her husband.
"Vernon!" she called. "Vernon, come back!"
"What?" he said, poking his head back around the door.
"Vernon, who did you say was on the phone?"
"Mrs. Figg," said Mr. Dursley, puzzled. "Why?"
"Vernon, she's dead."
"Dead?" said Mr. Dursley blankly. "Mrs. Figg, dead? But she was just --"
He stopped. He had been about to say that Mrs. Figg had been just the same as usual yesterday evening when she'd come to return the drill he'd lent her. But he suddenly remembered that he'd been in such a hurry to get out of the house this morning that he'd forgotten to give her back the drill. He'd have to go and do it now.
"I'd better go and see if Dudley's all right," said Mrs. Dursley, and she hurried upstairs.
Mr. Dursley frowned at the telephone. He didn't like mysteries. He picked up the receiver and listened.
"Hello?" he said.
But there was no sound except distant, crackling static.
Frowning, Mr. Dursley put the receiver back down and left the house. As he passed the garden wall, he looked up and down the street, but there was no sign of the cat. He got into his car and backed out of the drive, still frowning.
As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except Mrs. Figg. It was very strange and inconvenient that she'd died. She'd been a funny old bat, but harmless enough. He'd met her years ago, when she'd come to work as a nurse for his mother. She'd stayed with them for a few weeks and then, when Mrs. Dursley had got a job as a secretary at Grunnings, Mrs. Figg had come to live with them to look after Dudley. She'd been with them ever since.
Mr. Dursley reached the Grunnings parking lot and got out of his car. He was still thinking about Mrs. Figg as he walked across the road and into the bakery for a doughnut. He was so lost in thought that he didn't realize that the man in front of him in the line was wearing a violet cloak until he had paid for his doughnut and stepped outside again.
He stopped dead, staring at the man's back. It was the same man he'd walked into the day before. The man turned around, and Mr. Dursley saw that he had a long silver beard and bright blue eyes that twinkled behind half-moon spectacles.
"Hello again," said the man cheerfully. "Can't stop today, I'm afraid, I'm late already -- terribly sorry --"
And he hurried off.
Mr. Dursley stared after him. Then he walked back across the road, climbed into his car, and sat there, quite motionless, his doughnut forgotten. He didn't know what to do. He didn't understand what was going on. He'd spent his whole life avoiding things like this -- the strange, the abnormal, the magical.
And now, it seemed, the magical was coming to him, whether he liked it or not...
Chapter 2: The Vanishing Glass
Ten years ago, there had been a lot of owls in the sky, but of course, no one except real wizards and witches had realized what they were. Dementors had been sighted for the first time in a century, and though Muggles didn't know what they were, they had felt their presence, shivering and looking over their shoulders, even in the middle of summer.
But on this particular night in November, the wizarding world was enjoying a period of peace. The Ministry of Magic had recently announced that the threat presented by the wizard who had once terrorized the wizarding community was at an end, and though vigilance was still advised, the community was now enjoying its first breather in a decade.
In a small cottage on the outskirts of a village in the west of England, a witch named Sybill Trelawney was unpacking her suitcases. She had just moved into the cottage, which was old, damp, and infested with mice, but she didn't mind. She had lived in much worse places in her time, and at least this cottage was hers.
Sybill Trelawney was a tall, thin woman with long, straggly hair and a very prominent nose. She had large, glassy eyes that gave her a permanently startled look, and her voice was high and quavery. She was dressed in a long, flowing robe that was patched and frayed, and she wore a large number of beads and bracelets that jangled as she moved.
Sybill Trelawney was a Seer. She had inherited the gift from her grandmother, who had been a famous Seer in her day, and Sybill had been expecting to inherit it ever since she was a child. She had been disappointed when the gift had not manifested itself until she was in her twenties, but she had been overjoyed when it finally had.
Sybill had been working as a Seer ever since, and she had built up a small but loyal clientele. She had never been very successful, but she had always been able to make a living, and she had been content with that.
But now, Sybill was worried. She had been having a lot of strange visions lately, and she didn't know what they meant. She had seen a baby boy with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead, and she had seen a man with green eyes and a snake-like face. She had seen a castle, and a forest, and a three-headed dog. She had seen a lot of things that she didn't understand, and she didn't know what they meant.
Sybill sat down on her bed and sighed. She didn't know what to do. She had never had visions like this before, and she didn't know how to interpret them. She wished she had someone to talk to, someone who could help her understand what was happening.
But Sybill was alone. She had never been close to her family, and she had never had any friends. She had always been a solitary person, and she had always been content with that. But now, for the first time in her life, Sybill felt lonely.
Sybill got up and walked over to the window. She looked out at the dark night, and she wondered what the future held. She didn't know what was going to happen, but she knew that something was coming. She could feel it in her bones.
Sybill Trelawney was right. Something was coming, and it was coming soon.
In a small house in Godric's Hollow, a village in the west of England, a young couple named James and Lily Potter were getting ready for bed. They had just put their baby son, Harry, to sleep, and they were tired but happy.
James and Lily were both wizards, and they had been married for two years. They had been very happy together, and they had been looking forward to the birth of their son. Harry had been born a few months earlier, and he was a healthy, happy baby.
James and Lily loved their son very much, and they wanted to protect him from anything that might harm him. They had taken every precaution they could think of to keep him safe, and they had been careful not to draw attention to themselves.
But they knew that they couldn't hide forever. They knew that there were people out there who wanted to hurt them, and they knew that they couldn't protect Harry from everything.
James and Lily were worried, but they tried not to show it. They didn't want to frighten Harry, and they didn't want to spoil the happiness they had found.
But they knew that they couldn't ignore the danger forever. They knew that they had to face it, and they knew that they had to be prepared.
James and Lily got into bed and held each other close. They didn't say anything, but they both knew what the other was thinking. They were thinking about Harry, and they were thinking about the future.
They didn't know what was going to happen, but they knew that they were ready for anything. They were ready to fight for their son, and they were ready to die for him if they had to.
James and Lily fell asleep, and they didn't wake up until the morning. They got up and went to check on Harry, and they found him sleeping peacefully in his crib.
They smiled at each other, and they knew that everything was going to be all right. They knew that they had a lot to be grateful for, and they knew that they had a lot to look forward to.
But they didn't know that their happiness was about to be shattered. They didn't know that their world was about to be turned upside down.
They didn't know that the thing they feared the most was coming for them.
And they didn't know that it was coming that very night.

He breathed a sigh of relief and went to wake Dudley.
The Dursleys had a very ordinary sort of breakfast, which was just what Mr. Dursley liked. They had bacon and eggs and toast and tea and Dudley had a large glass of orange juice. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked up his briefcase. He was halfway to the door when the telephone rang. Mrs. Dursley looked at it.
"Aren't you going to answer it?" she asked.
"I'll let it ring," said Mr. Dursley. "It'll be for you. I expect it's that Mrs. Figg; she's always ringing up at this time of day."
Mrs. Dursley looked startled.
"Mrs. Figg? Why would she be ringing me?"
"Oh, I don't know," said Mr. Dursley, who was halfway out the door. "To borrow some sugar, or something. Bye, dear."
But Mrs. Dursley didn't go to answer the phone. She stood rooted to the spot, staring at her husband.
"Vernon!" she called. "Vernon, come back!"
"What?" he said, poking his head back around the door.
"Vernon, who did you say was on the phone?"
"Mrs. Figg," said Mr. Dursley, puzzled. "Why?"
"Vernon, she's dead."
"Dead?" said Mr. Dursley blankly. "Mrs. Figg, dead? But she was just --"
He stopped. He had been about to say that Mrs. Figg had been just the same as usual yesterday evening when she'd come to return the drill he'd lent her. But he suddenly remembered that he'd been in such a hurry to get out of the house this morning that he'd forgotten to give her back the drill. He'd have to go and do it now.
"I'd better go and see if Dudley's all right," said Mrs. Dursley, and she hurried upstairs.
Mr. Dursley frowned at the telephone. He didn't like mysteries. He picked up the receiver and listened.
"Hello?" he said.
But there was no sound except distant, crackling static.
Frowning, Mr. Dursley put the receiver back down and left the house. As he passed the garden wall, he looked up and down the street, but there was no sign of the cat. He got into his car and backed out of the drive, still frowning.
As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except Mrs. Figg. It was very strange and inconvenient that she'd died. She'd been a funny old bat, but harmless enough. He'd met her years ago, when she'd come to work as a nurse for his mother. She'd stayed with them for a few weeks and then, when Mrs. Dursley had got a job as a secretary at Grunnings, Mrs. Figg had come to live with them to look after Dudley. She'd been with them ever since.
Mr. Dursley reached the Grunnings parking lot and got out of his car. He was still thinking about Mrs. Figg as he walked across the road and into the bakery for a doughnut. He was so lost in thought that he didn't realize that the man in front of him in the line was wearing a violet cloak until he had paid for his doughnut and stepped outside again.
He stopped dead, staring at the man's back. It was the same man he'd walked into the day before. The man turned around, and Mr. Dursley saw that he had a long silver beard and bright blue eyes that twinkled behind half-moon spectacles.
"Hello again," said the man cheerfully. "Can't stop today, I'm afraid, I'm late already -- terribly sorry --"
And he hurried off.
Mr. Dursley stared after him. Then he walked back across the road, climbed into his car, and sat there, quite motionless, his doughnut forgotten. He didn't know what to do. He didn't understand what was going on. He'd spent his whole life avoiding things like this -- the strange, the abnormal, the magical.
And now, it seemed, the magical was coming to him, whether he liked it or not...
Chapter 4: The Keeper of the Keys
Mr. Dursley sat in his car, staring blankly at the steering wheel. He didn't know what to do. He didn't understand what was going on. He'd spent his whole life avoiding things like this -- the strange, the abnormal, the magical.
And now, it seemed, the magical was coming to him, whether he liked it or not.
He thought about the people in cloaks he'd seen that morning. He thought about the owls he'd seen flying in broad daylight. He thought about the cat reading a map. And he thought about the old man in the violet cloak who had hugged him and called him a Muggle.
Mr. Dursley didn't know what a Muggle was, but he was sure it wasn't anything good. He was sure it was something to do with the magical world, and he wanted nothing to do with it.
He started the car and drove to work, trying to put the whole thing out of his mind. But it wasn't easy. He kept thinking about the old man's words: "Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last!"
Who was You-Know-Who? And why should Mr. Dursley rejoice that he was gone?
Mr. Dursley tried to concentrate on his work, but it was no use. He couldn't stop thinking about the magical world, and he couldn't stop worrying about what it might want with him.
At lunchtime, he went for a walk to clear his head. He walked past the bakery where he'd seen the old man in the violet cloak, but there was no sign of him now. He walked past the bank, and the post office, and the library, and he didn't see a single person in a cloak.
He began to feel a little better. Maybe he'd imagined the whole thing. Maybe it was just a coincidence that he'd seen all those strange things in one day.
But then, as he turned the corner onto Privet Drive, he saw something that made his heart sink.
There was a cat sitting on his garden wall, and it was staring at him with its bright green eyes.
Mr. Dursley stopped dead. He knew it was the same cat he'd seen that morning. He was sure of it.
He walked slowly toward the cat, his heart pounding. The cat didn't move. It just stared at him with its unblinking eyes.
"Shoo!" said Mr. Dursley loudly.
The cat didn't move. It just kept staring at him.
Mr. Dursley took a step closer. The cat still didn't move.
And then, suddenly, it vanished.
Mr. Dursley blinked. He rubbed his eyes. He looked around. But the cat was gone.
He stood there for a moment, staring at the spot where the cat had been. And then he turned and walked slowly back to his car.
He didn't know what to think. He didn't know what to do. He just knew that he didn't want anything to do with the magical world.
But it seemed that the magical world had other ideas.
That night, Mr. Dursley had a dream. He dreamed that he was walking down a long, dark corridor. He didn't know where he was, or why he was there, but he knew that he had to keep walking.
At the end of the corridor, there was a door. Mr. Dursley reached out and turned the handle. The door swung open, and he found himself in a small, dimly lit room.
In the middle of the room, there was a table. And on the table, there was a cage.
Inside the cage, there was a bird. It was a small, scruffy-looking bird, with ruffled feathers and bright, beady eyes.
Mr. Dursley looked at the bird, and the bird looked at him. And then, suddenly, the bird spoke.
"You're a Muggle," it said.
Mr. Dursley stared at the bird in shock. He couldn't believe what he was hearing.
"You're a Muggle," the bird repeated. "And you're in danger."
Mr. Dursley shook his head. He didn't understand. He didn't want to understand.
"You have to leave," the bird said. "You have to leave now, before it's too late."
Mr. Dursley took a step back. He didn't know what to do. He didn't know where to go.
And then, suddenly, he woke up.
He was lying in his bed, in his own room, in his own house. He was safe.
But he didn't feel safe. He felt scared. He felt like he was in danger.
He got out of bed and went to the window. He looked out at the dark street, and he wondered what was out there, waiting for him.
He didn't know what to do. He didn't know where to turn.
And then, suddenly, he remembered something. He remembered the old man in the violet cloak, and the way he had hugged Mr. Dursley and called him a Muggle.
And he knew, with a sudden, sickening certainty, that the old man had been right. He was a Muggle. And he was in danger.
Mr. Dursley didn't know what to do. He didn't know where to go. He didn't know who to turn to.
But he knew one thing. He knew that he had to get away from Privet Drive, and the magical world, as fast as he could.
And so, the next morning, Mr. Dursley packed his bags, and he left. He didn't know where he was going, or what he was going to do. He just knew that he had to get away.
He drove for hours, until he was far away from Privet Drive, and the magical world, and everything he had ever known.
And then, finally, he stopped. He didn't know where he was, or what he was going to do. He just knew that he was safe.
For now.
Chapter 5: Diagon Alley
Mr. Dursley drove for hours, until he was far away from Privet Drive, and the magical world, and everything he had ever known. He didn't know where he was going, or what he was going to do. He just knew that he had to get away.
He drove until he was tired, and then he stopped at a small inn by the side of the road. He rented a room for the night, and he went to bed.
He didn't sleep well. He tossed and turned, and he dreamed of cats with bright green eyes, and owls flying in broad daylight, and people in cloaks whispering about the Potters.
In the morning, he got up and he packed his bags. He didn't know where he was going, or what he was going to do. He just knew that he had to keep moving.
He drove for hours, until he was hungry. He stopped at a small town, and he went into a cafe. He ordered a cup of tea and a sandwich, and he sat down at a table by the window.
He was just about to take a bite of his sandwich when he saw something that made him freeze.
There was a cat sitting on the windowsill, staring at him with bright green eyes.
Mr. Dursley stared back at the cat, his heart pounding. He knew it was the same cat he'd seen on Privet Drive. He was sure of it.
He got up from the table and he walked slowly toward the cat. The cat didn't move. It just kept staring at him.
"Shoo!" said Mr. Dursley loudly.
The cat didn't move. It just kept staring at him.
